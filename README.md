You'll find source files in `script.babel` directory. Boilerplate code is genereate using Yeoman generator-chrome-extension.

### Install dependencies
Nvigate to root folder in your terminal to install project dependencies.

npm install
```

### Babel

This extension supports ES 2015 syntax through babel transforming. While developing, When those of source has been changed, `gulp babel` should be run before test and run a extension on Chrome.

```sh
gulp babel
```

If you would like to have a continuous transforming by babel you can use `watch` task (recommended).

### Watch

Watch task helps you reduce your efforts during development extensions. If the task detects your changes of source files, re-compile your sources automatically or Livereload([chromereload.js](https://github.com/HemantPawar/hasjob-extension/blob/master/app/scripts.babel/chromereload.js)) reloads your extension. If you would like to know more about Live-reload and preview of Yeoman? Please see [Getting started with Yeoman and generator-webapp](http://youtu.be/zBt2g9ekiug?t=3m51s) for your understanding.

```bash
gulp watch
```

You need to load/reload extension after starting `gulp watch` for Live-reload to work.

For content scripts you need to refresh pages where it is used.
